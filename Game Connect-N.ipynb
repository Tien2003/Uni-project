    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this assignment, you will implement a **Connect-N** game, an extension of the popular **Connect-4** game. Connect-4 is a two-player connection board game in which the players first choose a colour and then take turns dropping one coloured disc from the top into a **seven-column, six-row** vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of **four of one's own discs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have never played Connect 4, you can find the rules and try the game here: https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connect-N** game is a variation of **Connect-4** where the grid expands to **N+2 Columns** and **N+3 rows**. The winning condition becomes the first to form horizontal, diagonal line of **N of one's own discs**.  **N** will be a positive integer number larger or equal to 3, i.e. 3, 4, 5, 6... etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifications\n",
    "You need to implement the following two functions:\n",
    "- `have_winner()`: returns `True` if either player has won the game, otherwise returns `False`\n",
    "- `drop_disk(c, player)`: player drop a disk at $c_{th}$ colomn. Return 1 if successfully drop the disk, return 0 if this is a illegal move, e.g. the colomn is full\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided some utility functions to you:\n",
    "- `init_board`: start the board\n",
    "- `display`: draw the board\n",
    "- `game`: the main loop that starts the game and allows the players to drop disk in turns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rubric\n",
    "* Program functionality meets specifications\n",
    "  * `drop_disk(col, player)` works correctly (30 marks)\n",
    "  * `have_winner()` supports horizontal and vertical win conditions (50 marks)\n",
    "* Comments (20 marks)\n",
    "  * The comments should clearly state the purpose of every *code block* or *line* you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "You earn **10 bonus marks** for completing the diagonal win condition."
